    Base class of all other error exceptions.

    Exception that is the base class of all other error exceptions.
    You can use this to catch all errors with one single except

    Errors that are related to the database interface.

    Errors that are related to the database's operation.

    Exception raised for errors that are related to the database's
    operation and not necessarily under the control of the programmer,
    e.g. an unexpected disconnect occurs, the data source name is not
    found, a transaction could not be processed, a memory allocation

    Raised when the database encounters an internal error.

    Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error,

    Raised in case a method or database API is not supported.

    connection that does not support transaction or has transactions
    turned off. It must be a subclass of DatabaseError.
