    Node type.

    A node can have 4 types, currently:

    1. SOURCE nodes are root nodes in the DAG, and point to tables or views in a DB.
    2. TRANSFORM nodes are SQL transformations, reading from SOURCE/TRANSFORM nodes.
    3. METRIC nodes are leaves in the DAG, and have a single aggregation query.
    4. DIMENSION nodes are special SOURCE nodes that can be auto-joined with METRICS.
    5. CUBE nodes contain a reference to a set of METRICS and a set of DIMENSIONS.
