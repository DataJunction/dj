  For each US region (as defined in the us_region table), we want to calculate:
    Regional Repair Efficiency = (Number of Completed Repairs / Total Repairs Dispatched) ×
                                (Total Repair Amount in Region / Total Repair Amount Nationwide) × 100
    Here:
        A "Completed Repair" is one where the dispatched_date is not null.
        "Total Repair Amount in Region" is the total amount spent on repairs in a given region.
        "Total Repair Amount Nationwide" is the total amount spent on all repairs nationwide.

  SELECT
  (SUM(rm.completed_repairs) * 1.0 / SUM(rm.total_repairs_dispatched)) *
  (SUM(rm.total_amount_in_region) * 1.0 / SUM(na.total_amount_nationwide)) * 100
  FROM
  ${prefix}roads.regional_level_agg rm
  CROSS JOIN
  ${prefix}roads.national_level_agg na
