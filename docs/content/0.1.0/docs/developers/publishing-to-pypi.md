title: "Releasing New Version"

The DataJunction project publishes its server and Python client library to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and its UI service to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

DataJunction builds weekly Alpha (in the future Beta/RC) releases automatically, but you can run the same workflow for a specific manual release.
