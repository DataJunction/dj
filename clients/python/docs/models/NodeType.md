# djclient.model.node_type.NodeType

Node type.  A node can have 4 types, currently:  1. SOURCE nodes are root nodes in the DAG, and point to tables or views in a DB. 2. TRANSFORM nodes are SQL transformations, reading from SOURCE/TRANSFORM nodes. 3. METRIC nodes are leaves in the DAG, and have a single aggregation query. 4. DIMENSION nodes are special SOURCE nodes that can be auto-joined with METRICS. 5. CUBE nodes contain a reference to a set of METRICS and a set of DIMENSIONS.
